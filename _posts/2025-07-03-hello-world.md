## ðŸ”­ What is **Copernicus** in Houdini?



**Copernicus** is a cutting-edge context in Houdiniâ€”a **2D and 3D GPU-accelerated image processing framework** offering real-time manipulation of images and textures. Itâ€™s perfect for tasks like building texture maps, setting up compositing workflows (slap comps), and creating stylized visuals like toon shading, all within Houdini.

At first glance, it resembles tools such as [Substance Designer](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d/apps/designer.html) and [Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke), featuring powerful node-based workflows. What makes Copernicus truly unique, however, is its **seamless integration with all the other contexts in Houdini**, allowing you to:

* Create an **RBD simulation** and bake it into a height texture map
* Use **Slap Comps** for compositing directly inside Houdini
* Develop **toon shaders** or NPR powered by GPU workflows

In short, Copernicus opens a **highly efficient, versatile space for real-time GPU-based visual workflows**, fully embedded within Houdiniâ€™s procedural pipeline.

## COP I - Understanding SDFs & Pattern Creation

In this first video, I'll guide you into the world of patterns and explain why we use SDFs in Copernicus.

## COP II - Understanding UVs in Copernicus

UVs are essential when working in Copernicus.
Today, Iâ€™ll walk you through everything you need to know, UV distortions, polar UVs, and how UVs behave in Copernicus, which works a bit differently than you might expect.

## COP III - Full Material Workflow

With a solid grasp of SDFs, patterns, UVs, and distortions, we'll now bring it all together to create a fill material from scratch. Along the way, I'll introduce new techniques like UV randomization and some new nodes that will prove extremely useful.
