**Originally from Italy**, *visual arts have been my passion for as long as I can remember.*

I worked as a **photographer** for several years before transitioning into the **VFX industry** two years ago. Today, my focus is on **education**.

I'm currently an **Environment Art Professor** at *Voxel School*, where I teach **Houdini** and **Unreal Engine**. I also founded **NodeFlow**, a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nodeflowhoudini) supported by *SideFX*, where I share educational content with the community.

In **2024**, I was one of the few winners of **The Rookies Contest**. My work has been featured by **NVIDIA**, and I’ve had the opportunity to publish articles about my art on respected platforms such as *3D World*, *Creative Bloq*, *The Rookies*, and *Think Tank Training Center*.

You can view one of my personal projects here: [**Nature**](https://vimeo.com/865083222)

If you’ve read this far — thank you. I’m excited to collaborate, whether as a **professor** or a **Houdini generalist**.
