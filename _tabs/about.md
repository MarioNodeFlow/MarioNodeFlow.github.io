Originally from Italy, visual arts have been my passion for as long as I can remember. 
I worked as photographer for several years and I joined the VFX industry 2 years ago.
Now I focus on Education!

Iâ€™m working as an Environment art professor at Voxel school, teaching Houdini & Unreal.
I also founded NodeFlow, a Youtube channel supported by SideFX where I share educational content with the community.

In 2024 I was one of the few winners of the Rookies Context, my work has been featured by NVIDIA, and I had the chance to publish articles regarding my art in leading platforms like 3D World, Creative Bloq, The Rookies & Think Tank Training Center.

And Hey, if you read it until here, thank you so much, I am excited to work with you, either as Professor or as Houdini Generalist!
